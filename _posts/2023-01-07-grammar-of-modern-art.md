title: The Grammar of Installation Art

This blog post is a result of ruminations resulting from my visit to the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and how much my experience there differed from
visiting museums and installations of art before this experience. Installation
art is a completely new and different creative endeavour, and I wanted to
explore the relationship between philosophical trajectories, art, and grammar
based on my study of linguistics into a single, (hopefully) coherent writeup.

## Grammar

As users of language(s) in our day to day lives, we have come to agree that
there exist a set of guidelines by which we communicate our thoughts in order
for them to be intelligible. Should language be used as a medium of
communication or expression of thought, there is some consistency to be expected
in how those thoughts are presented, and the implications that arise from the
deviation from these guidelines. Famously, there are two camps of grammarians:
prescriptivists and descriptivists.

- For prescriptivists, language as a phenomena is to be built
around the scaffolding of a grammatical framwork. Deviations from this
scaffolding, from the norms that preserve the structure and function of
meaningful units in a language is deemed *ungrammatical*.
- For descriptivists, language is living and provides a plethora of patterns if
studied from the lenses of phenomenological context. These patterns present how
thoughts can be expressed so as to be understood by other users of the language,
and deviations from these patterns provides insight into the relationship
between patterned structure and meaning.

Both views on grammar have their place in the history of language, not that the
divide between prescriptivism and descriptivism is specific to the field of
linguistics.

With that wordy introduction, the rest of this post does not use the term
grammar as a concept in linguistics, rather as a stand-in for the duality of
structur and emergent patterns. Elements of the grammar of impressionism, for
example, would (non-exhaustively, of course) include subject(s), light, and
perspective. The composition of these elements in a manner that presents an
observer's impression of a scene (or the artist's if you are not a postmodernist
and have not killed the artist) is what define an impressionist work of art,
much like the composition of nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions etc. makes a
sentence grammatical in English.

Note here that the grammar takes a few intersting concepts for granted. It does
not specify a medium of interaction. For example, the elements that make an
impressionist painting do not ascribe the medium through which the work of art
is presented, i.e. watercolour on paper, oil on canvas, charcoal, tile, etc.
This, similar to how grammar does not necessarily dictate whether the language
it draws patterns from are novels, social media threads, or telephone
conversations (albeit the actual use of language is radically different based
on the context).

It is in the conception of modern and postmodern art that the notion of grammar
becomes interesting.

## What is Art Meant to Do?

In my opinion, art is meant to evoke emotion. The grammar of art, therefore, is
a study of the patterns that emerge from the effort of evoking emotion. Within
"traditional art", i.e. paintings and sculptures (to a degree), the grammar is
bounded by the medium used to present the aesthetic experience.

For example,
when I as on observer look at *A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re*, I know that
whatever my evoked emotional experience, it is bounded by the borders of the
painting. My experience is not so rightly altered by the fact that the painting
is oil-on-canvas, and not, say, watercolour. Of course, one might argue that the
combination of ambient light and the presentation of brushstrokes in
oil-on-canvas significantly alter the intended emotion of the painting, but I am
skeptical of such a claim. The elements I am meant to be looking at include the
subjects, the gradient of light and shadow, and the perspective of the artist,
and thus of me observing the barmaid speak to a patron just out of frame. The
composition evokes the sense of wanton familiarity after a work day at a posh
bar by combining these abstract structural elements.

And such a rudimentary
analysis can be done for almost every "traditional" work of art, from frescos to
Van Gogh.

It is here that installation art comes and baffles my sensibilities to a large
degree. What is the grammar of installation art? What are the focal elements,
which when composed, provide an aesthetic experience or evoke emotion? During my
visit to SF MoMA, I found myself far more interested in the plaques that
described the works of art that the art itself. Suddenly, the elements of art
that never really struck me as important, crucial, or even relevant for focus
on, such as the materials used, the way the work warps the space around it, the
space the work occupies outside of itself, the way the work changes through
time, these were the relevant aspects meant to evoke emotion.

What is more, each work demands that a new set of elements be considered in
order to evoke the emotion intended by the creator, and each creator's unique
style involved a reconstruction of the patterns that mattered to them. If this
is the case, how is one to construct the grammar of installation art? What are
the elements that are necessary to look at, and what is meant to be discarded?
Is art so subjective that any internally consistent grammar provides a similar
enough richness of experience as intended by the creator?

The prescriptivist in me kept trying to assess individual pieces on the merit of
their composition of rudimentary abstract elements and constantly failing,
thereby evoking the emotions of curious confusion. The descriptivist in me kept
trying to identify patterns between installations and failing to identify which
elements these patterns existed in. It was as if a sentence had been spoken
which didn't have nouns or verbs, or even references and objects, but I was to
be convinced it was a sentence in English. I was baffled.

Each installation at MoMA was unique in that regard. The elements I was meant to
look at and appreciate changed from piece to piece, and for the artworks that
lacked any discernable explanation of what the work implied, I was stumped, not
knowing what to look at, not knowing how the work was to be framed in my mind,
befuddled at the abstractions I was meant to be drawing and how the composition
was meant to evoke the emotion the creator intended.

To the part of my mind that tries to compare this to idiolects, I claim that an
idiolect is, by definition, personal. Is the study of installation art meant to
be studied as an idiolect?

## An Edit, A Conclusion, and Some Afterthought

After showing this piece of writing to a few thinkers in the space of art and
art history as well as just gather general opinions on it from a larger audience
of modern, contemporary, and ``traditional'' art, I have come to learn the
following.

What art is meant to do is evoke emotion, and so installation
art has a mechanism of doing so that remains fundamentally consistent within
discourse of that field. However, to extrapolate its grammar is to study the 
use of space as a structuralist, for a mechanism of expression that is inherently
post-structuralist. The examination of this dichotomy reveals that the study
of grammar as a way to study evocation assumes a tacit connection between
the two which has not been defined by the art (or the schools of thought it
represents). The questions "how do I know what to look at when I see this?"
and "how should this make me feel?" are inherently disjointed, as is one of
the missions of this art.

Grammarians enjoy touting "form is function" and to that, I both agree and
politely ask that the function of art be defined in a manner where form
plays a role. Form does not evoke emotion, form is just a mechanism to
convey evocation of emotion and intensity. Perhaps the form that installation
art takes requires a deeper understanding of the subjective function
each piece occupies.
