title: Context Representation in User Modeling (A Workshop Initiative)

We are organizing a workshop! Together with some of my colleagues
at the lab, we are organizing a workshop at the UMAP conference
this year on the representation of context and its impact on user
modeling. These are my thoughts.

# How it started

One afternoon, one of my colleagues at the ADAPT lab, Jovan
Jeromela, brought it up during lunch that our guide, Prof.
Owen Conlan, wanted us to run a workshop. "It would be very
useful for research experience," he claimed and the researchers
there ruminated on the prospect of having our own workshop.
It seemed thrilling enough, so we set up a google calendar
event to discuss what exactly we would have our workshop on.

The subject of the workshop is a topic of contention for our
group. This is because of the group of people who decided to
work on organizing this workshop, none of us work on even
remotely the same topic. In fact, we probably are not in the
same field.

- Jovan works on scrutibility in personalized time management
systems
- Dipto Barman works on fake news and exposure personalization
- Hassan Zaal works on care-giving human-robot interaction for
elderly patients
- Awais Akbar works on route pathing and planning as per user
preferences

How did we resolve this? Well, we did a one-minute rapid thesis
presentation of our work while noting down the keywords that
were the most prominent towards a subject, area, or topic.
We then analysed the relationship between our topics and
realized that one interesting common thread between all our
work was the relevance and importance of context. In each of
our work, representing and considering contextual information
changes the way the agent would make decisions and generally
impacts agent behaviour and its appropriateness in the context
of the interaction.

# Topics of Interest

Once it was defined that we were setting up a workshop that
deals with the representation of context in intelligent
systems which was broadly within the domina of user modeling,
adaptive systems, and personalization, the next question
was how to choose the relevant topics of interest. Thankfully,
we had help from conferences and workshops surrounding the study
of contextual information in recommender systems and
other avenues of ubiquitous computing. We decided to increase
our focus on scrutibility as a key focus of context and
relevance for our topics of interest for the workshop. 

Overall, the lens from which context was contextualized
was to look at user-centric recommender-like systems and how
context might play a role if correctly captured and used.

# Papers and Actual Workshop

Featuring four accepted papers out of five submitted, and
being one of teh first workshops to showcase the divergent
viewpoints in scrutibility within the confines of an
atypical theoretical domain of context relevance, this workshop
was an avenue for researchers of differnt verticles of 
user-based design and computing research to understand context.

The workshop featured papers from ubiquitous computing for
health, route planning, and hierarchical recommender systems,
even in its smaller number of submissions. The format of the 
workshop included a keynote by Co-chair Prof. Judy Kay, the paper
presentations, a panel disucssion, and a joint workshop brainstorming
activity

Prof. Masthoff started the program with her opening talk
with a presentation which explored and analyzed the role
of context in understanding systems and scrutinizing them, which
became a topic of conversation for the rest of the workshop.
The panel, comprising of speakers Prof. Judith Masthoff,
Dr. Barakat A. Yilma, Dr. David Massimo, and co-chair Prof. Owen Conlan
(which I was not able to capture cuz it was not hybrid and I did not
travel to Cyprus).

# Final Thoughts

Organizing this workshop was fun. While I think having two former
general chairs of the conference our workshop was co-located with
definitely helps, I view it as a well-deserved success. The workshop
fostered spirited academic debate, and is shaping up to be a venue
which provides value to the user modeling as well as the analysis of
computing community at large.
